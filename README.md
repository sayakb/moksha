Moksha: Site building application
==================================

Copyright (c) 2012 Sayak Banerjee <mail@sayakbanerjee.com>

Moksha is a powerful site building utility that makes your life easy!

 * You can create a new site from a central administration panel by simply
   entering the new URL (and pointing your apache configuration to your Moksha's
   installation directory).
 * Creating pages involve merely dragging and dropping controls (HTML elements)
   and selecting any data source to bind to them from a menu.

With Moksha, you can build a fully blown blog or wiki in a matter of minutes.

Moksha is currently in its inception phase. However, the first usable version
is now available and has been tagged as version 1.0
