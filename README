Moksha: Site building application
Copyright (c) 2012 Sayak Banerjee <sayakb@kde.org>

Moksha is a utility that lets you design and develop versatile websites without
writing a single line of code. You can create and modify your websites right
from the admin widget panel.

Moksha is currently in its inception phase. We will tag the first usable version
as v1.0, so stay tuned!
